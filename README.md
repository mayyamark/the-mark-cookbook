# The Mark Cookbook
I am very excited to present you my first personal project!
This is an application for cooking recipes! Here you can find recipes by a category, or you can search a recipe by its name! You can create new categories and new recipes! You can edit old recipes and to manage their images!

# Used packages
- **Backend Packages**: express, cors, body-parser, helmet, multer, mariadb, moment, eslint, nodemon;

- **Frontend packages**: React, react-dom, react-router-dom, react-slideshow-image, moment, sweetalert, material-ui, eslint;

# Running Guide
Follow these steps to run our application:
## Step I:
**Import the SQL files**, the schemas and the file with dummy data.

## Step II:
Open the Terminal in the server folder and type the following commands:
```
npm i

This will run my React application.
